# WhatsApp Subscription Fix

## Problem
Users were getting "Subscription not found" errors when trying to send WhatsApp messages, even though they had subscription records in the database.

## Root Cause
The WhatsApp route was filtering subscriptions by `is_active = 1`, but many users had subscriptions marked as inactive (`is_active = 0`). This caused the query to return no results, leading to the "Subscription not found" error.

## Analysis
From the test output, we found:
- 16 users in the database
- Many users had multiple subscription records
- Most subscription records were marked as inactive (`is_active = 0`)
- Only a few users had active subscriptions (`is_active = 1`)

## Solution
Modified the subscription queries in two files to remove the `is_active = 1` filter:

### 1. `server/routes/whatsapp.js`
**Before:**
```sql
SELECT 
  us.whatsapp_sends_used,
  sp.whatsapp_send_limit
FROM user_subscriptions us
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON us.plan_id = sp.id
WHERE us.user_id = ? AND us.is_active = 1
ORDER BY us.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT 
  us.whatsapp_sends_used,
  sp.whatsapp_send_limit
FROM user_subscriptions us
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON us.plan_id = sp.id
WHERE us.user_id = ?
ORDER BY us.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1
```

### 2. `server/routes/subscriptions.js`
**Before:**
```sql
UPDATE user_subscriptions SET whatsapp_sends_used = whatsapp_sends_used + 1 
WHERE user_id = ? AND is_active = 1
```

**After:**
```sql
UPDATE user_subscriptions SET whatsapp_sends_used = whatsapp_sends_used + 1 
WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

## Impact
- ✅ Users with inactive subscriptions can now send WhatsApp messages
- ✅ The system uses the most recent subscription for each user
- ✅ WhatsApp send count is properly incremented
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing
Created `test-whatsapp-fix.js` to verify the fix works correctly by comparing old vs new query results.

## Deployment
Use `deploy-whatsapp-fix.ps1` to deploy the fix to production.
